# "That's Nothing to Me" - A Reappraisal

1. Disagreeable Impression -> Check assumptions -> If you can't do anything then "That's Nothing to me".
2. Dicotomy of control: Is this under my control? Can I do something about this? 
3. Passivity isn't what Stoicism is about - it's a prompt that does it really matter to "me".
4. prohairesis - "What I really am". 
   1. Faculty of choice say "yes / no / maybe" based on perception.
5. Epictetus asserted that we are our "prohairesis" our faculty of choice.
6. Buddhist Similarity that's less ambiguous:
   1. Form, Feeling, Perception, Choices and Consciousness are not _YOU_.
   2. If it was, you would have complete control over it.
      1. Can't stop aging.
   3. For each of these, this is not mine, I am not this and therefore, I am not in control.
7. Things Buddha and Epictetus wouldn't agree on
   1. NOTHING is in complete control. Epictetus would argue prohairesis is.
8. "That's nothing to me" =/= "Don't sweat the small stuff"
9. "That's nothing to me" ~ "This is not mine, I am not this, this is not myself".
10. Oikeios - A tool for remembering what's really our own / making your own
    1. Personal Appropriation or bring to your own - claiming ownership.
       1. Discipline of Desire: 
           1. Not caring about the outcome but reactions to the outcome. 
           2. Sort into Externals and Internals.
           3. Externals - not mine.
           4. Prohairesis - Me and mine.
    2.  Social Appropriation: Caring about other people
        1.  Not just peace of mind but care about other peoples to expand self to the world.
