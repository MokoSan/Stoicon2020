      1. Neo-Stoicism - John Sellars (check it out.)
3. Epictetus' Fork aka Dichotomy of Control
   1. All things that are up to us: Our priories, decisions to act or not to act and judgements.
   2. All things that aren't up to us: Everything else: we can take decisions but the outcome is not up to us.
   3. Internal, conscious (In our control) <-> External (Not in our control)
   4. Internalize your goals
      1. Your efforts / attempts are up to. Outcomes aren't! 
      2. You can influence but not control it.
   5. 3 Disciplines of Epictetus
      1. __Desire__: What we want.
      2. __Assent__: Improving our judgement; most difficult but important. Affects desire and action.
      3. __Action__: How to deal with other people and act in life.
4. 7 Areas to Update
   1. Externals don't need to be despised
      1. Epictetus and Seneca encourage us to despise externals.
      2. FACT: Virtue cannot be practiced except on externals.
      3. However, externals remain not necessary, but not preferred.
   2. No need to cultivate indifference to human loss
      1. To embrace event hte death of a loved one may appear callous, but Epictetus which makes it reasonable to love your fate (*amor fati*). 
      2. FACT: Fate needs to be endured but it cannot reasonably be embraced.
   3. Live according to nature
      1. Nature means participating in the Logos, the ability to bne rational. Universe is a living organism.
      2. FACT: Rationality evolved locally as a result of series of historical twists and turns. There is nothing inevitable or cosmic about it.
         1. Accept the facts of science; the best we understand the universe.
   4. Questionable science or metaphysics
      1. Ancient stoics believed in divinations, which for them a reasonable collary of the notion of a universal web of cause-effect.
      2. FACT: We believe in the latter, but not the former.
         1. Hegemonikon is not in the heart.
   5. God or atoms
      1. Ancient stoics recover the ancient concept of a Universe-God. The world is akin to a living organism.
      2. FACT: Argument of design is flawed - Hume and Darwin put these arguments to rest.
      3. Marcus Aurelius himself realized, nothing much of consequence follows from this i.e. either God or atoms.
      4. Stoics __did__ connect metaphysics, ethics and logic. However, those connections aren't rigid. It's a web of interconnections.
   6. Local customs are neither universal nor immutable
      1. Stoics were naturally people of their time.
      2. FACT: Some of the social customs don't make sense for us.
         1. E.g. Status of women. Sex was only procreation.
   7. Social Justice
      1. Stoics said that Slavery is bad but they had no concept of justice at a societal level (in contradistinction from an individual level).
      2. Modern authors are now reflecting on how a Stoic framework can inform issues of justice and environmentalism.
5. Stoicism has always been, a living, evolving, practical philosophy of life.
