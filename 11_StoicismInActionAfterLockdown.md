# Stoicism in Action After Lockdown

1. Some positives of the pandemic:
   1. We have become more resilient.
   2. More neighborly and public-spirited. 
   3. More environmentally sustainable.
2. Stoicism can provide a framework for acting in this way deliberately and consistently and not just as a response to pressure.
3. How can Stoicism Help us?
   1. Practicing Stoic Exercises
   2. Reflecting on Key Stoic Ideas underlying on those exercises.
4. What Can Promote Resilience?
   1. Exercising the dichotomy of control - distinguishing between what is and is not within our control and focusing on doing properly what can actually affect and accepting that a great deal doesn't fall in our power.
   2. Distinguishing between the two kind of things is crucial. 
   3. Check out Meditations 4.49.
      1. I can bear it without getting upset.
      2. What has happened cannot prevent you from being just, high-minded, self-controlled, thoughtful, self-respecting, free.
5. Promoting Neighborliness and Sense of Human Community
   1. Pandemic has revived the sense of interdependence.
   2. Stoicism offers a framework for building on these outcomes in a reflective and consistent way.
   3. Stoicism pushes you to create an "inner citadel" i.e. taking care of yourself.
   4. Human Beings are fundamentally rationally and sociable.
      1. Humans have instinctive motive to care for others, as well as ourselves.
   5. Contracting the Circles of Relationship: Second Exercise - Hierocles Circles
      1. You are at the center of a series of circle of relationships.
         1. Immediate family, extended family etc.
      2. Working on trying to reduce the circles by treating the outer circles the same importance as the inner circle.
   6. Provides a mental map to maintain a sense of our relationships even if we are not in contact with people directly.
      1. Counteract a sense of isolation.
      2. All humans, as social and rational animals, are a part of a single family and co-citizens of the world we all share.
   7. Promoting Environmental Responsibility
      1. Initially, less car use, less leisure travel and flying.
         1. Significant reduction in CO2 reductions and air pollution.
      2. Need to do even better in a systematic global way to prevent worse consequences later.
      3. Stoicism tells us that our happiness depends on living according to the virtues. A modern stoic cannot live virtuously, while ignoring the biggest problem facing human beings and our world, more serious and lasting the pandemic.
      4. Stoicism stresses that human beings are, fundamentally, parts of the natural world; that we should try and live our lives in accordance with the order which is built into the natural world.
      5. Marcus Aurelius, Meditations 2.9
      6. Not booking mini-break vacations that'll increase the carbon footprint.
         1. In Stoic terms, this isn't a good idea as we won't be acting wisely, justly, with self-control and courageous.
