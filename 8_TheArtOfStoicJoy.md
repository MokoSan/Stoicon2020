# The Art of Stoic Joy

1. David was always in the marble. Taking every that wasn't David out is what Michelangelo did.
2. Strategy of Elimination i.e. the Stoic Elimination of What's Not Needed 
   1. What should be do to create joy? -> What should we take away?
   2. Joy is always within us
      1. We have happiness within us.
      2. We just need to take away everything that is not joy.
   3. Drive away all things that disturb or frighten you, there follows joy! - Seneca.
   4. All happiness you can have it now if you leave your past behind - Marcus
   5. We burden ourselves with so many things that they weigh us down. Just lay the burden down - Epictetus.
3. Just get rid of the burdens you are carrying.
   1. Burdens aren't physical burdens but psychological burdens that we aren't aware that we carrying.
4. 4 types of Burdens
   1. __Foolishness__: Not knowing what to do and what not to do.
      1. If our judgements are correct, we don't act foolish.
      2. Anything that comes our way, it is our business or not our business.
         1. Limiting our actions to our business, we act correctly.
      3. Everything generated by our mind is our business.
         1. What we like, dislike, intentions and actions.
      4. Not our business not dependent on our mind - externals. We don't control these.
         1. Body, reputation, wealth, natural disasters.
         2. Whatever we do, these things aren't in our control.
         3. For example, we can't control when we die. However, we have control over we take care of ourselves.
      5. If we insist on carrying this burden, we will be hindered and disturbed. 
      6. Penalty on carrying this burden: no penalty, you will be unhappy.
      7. Foolishness is the largest burden we carry.
   2. __Excess__: Not knowing what to select and what not to select.
      1. Desires of wants lead to lack of fulfillment excesses.
         1. Wealth
         2. Power
         3. Drugs
         4. Alcohol
      2. Desires of wants
         1. Insatiable
            1. Want more and more without satiation.
         2. Comparative
            1. Keeping up with the Jones.
         3. Lead to Slavery
            1. Anyone that can fulfil our desire of wants becomes our master.
      3. Laying down the burden of excess. 
         1. Stoicism doesn't ask to ignore the good things in life. 
            1. These are not essentials. 
         2. It is the excess we should be worried about and not enjoyment.
   3. __Fearfulness__: Not knowing what is terrible and what is not that we are afraid of.
      1. Being sick, poor, losing loved ones etc. i.e. not under our control
      2. What we should be fearful of that's under our control.
         1. Striving for more things
         2. Judging things wrong
         3. Being unjust
      3. We are fearful of many things that aren't in our control. As a result, we relinquish things under control.
   4. __Injustice__: Not knowing how to give everyone their due.
      1. Justice is a social control: we don't harm others so don't harm us. Justice is nothing in itself without such understanding.
      2. A stoic would be just in all circumstances.
      3. Justice is an aspect of compassion. Others suffer like we do.
      4. Stoic sense of justice - what happens to others isn't our concern.
      5. "It's his art of living" - you henceforth, released from all accountability to your parents, brothers, property, life and death.
      6. We don't anything to make others happy. 
      7. No one has the power to hurt us. We hurt ourselves.
      8. Implies, we don't have the power to hurt others. Others hurt themselves.
      9. Why is injustice a burden? Because it hurts us! When we don't give others what is rightfully theirs, we believe that it will benefit us. Foolishness is a burden, not a road to joy.
5.  Foolishness => Practical Wisdom. Excess => Moderation. Fearfulness => Courage. Injustice => Justice.
